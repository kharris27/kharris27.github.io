      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <hr>
      <h2>Hello There! I am currently a Senior at Eastern Washington University, pursuing a Visual Communication Design Bachelor’s Degree, Computer Applications minor, Information Security Management minor, Business Administration minor and UX Certificate. Future UX Designer and Web Designer.

       <br><br> As I spent many years figuring out who I am and what I love to do, I found myself within the design program at Eastern. I have always wanted to create things that are a mix between technology and design. I found my passion early on in my high school years where I was a web master for the High School’s web page. I even created a whole new website during my time there. I quickly fell in love with this career. Technology is growing exponentially, and I want to give individuals a better experience when it comes to the internet and what it has to offer. I can’t wait to share with you my projects! One very important thing that I have learned so far, while pursuing my degree is that always think about the end-users; whether the design is physical or digital, the end product is for the end-user.
        
       <br><br> My hobbies include playing video games, baking, playing violin or guitar, obsessing over food and spending time outside with my dog. If you want to see current work I am doing, follow me! If you have a questions or comments, feel free to contact me!
